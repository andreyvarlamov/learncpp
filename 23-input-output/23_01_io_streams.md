Hierarchy of classes responsible for providing I/O functionality.

### Streams

### Input/output in C++

### Standard streams in C++
cin, cout, cerr (std err, unbuffered) and clog (std err, buffered)

Buffered output is typically handled immediately, buffered - stored and written out as a
block. clog isn't used very often.
