# 16.6 - Container classes

Designed to hold and organize multiple instances of another type.

Value containers are compositions that store copies of the objects that ehy are holding
(and thus are responsible for creating and destroying those copies).

Reference containers are aggregations that store pointers or references to other objects
(and thus are not responsible for creating or destroying those objects).

E.g. some kind of an array.
