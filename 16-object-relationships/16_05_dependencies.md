# 16.5 - Dependencies

One object invokes another objet's functionality in order to accomplish some specific
task.

Associations are a relationship between two classes at the class level. That is, one class
keeps a direct or indirect "link" to the associated class as a member. Dependencies
typically are not represented at the class level - not linked as a member, instead
instantiated locally as needed.
